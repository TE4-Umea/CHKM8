This is to make it easy to push to Git and they can also be hosted on a static host in the future (like Github pages.)\n\n#### Old title / New title\nWhen creating a new page, the old title and new title should be same. If you are renaming a page, keep the old title and change the new one. ***Note**, renaming a class will disable all it's children if their class isn't changed manually in the JSON's*","type":"text","pinned":true,"title":"Welcome","class":null}
